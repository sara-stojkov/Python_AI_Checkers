# Python AI Checkers - The user _vs_ the algorithm
University project for course "Data Structures and Algorithms". 

### Algorithm
Made using **MiniMax algorithm** with ALpha-Beta pruning for best performance. 

The bot picks the best move by rating and evaluating each position so it can explore the decision tree and choose the best option. The heuristics can be seen in the code, the parameters used here were the ones scientifically shown to be the most important.

### GUI
**PyGame** was used for making GUI, a game like this needed to be visualised out of the console.
